"Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. The action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates.  The decision was taken to move toward a less accommodative stance in monetary policy in order to sustain and enhance the economic expansion.  Chairman Greenspan decided to announce this action immediately so as to avoid any misunderstanding of the Committee's purposes, given the fact that this is the first firming of reserve market conditions by the Committee since early 1989.",1994-03-22

"The Federal Reserve today announced two actions designed to maintain favorable trends in inflation and thereby sustain the economic expansion.  The Board approved an increase in the discount rate from 3 percent to 3-1/2 percent, effective immediately, and the Federal Open Market Committee agreed that this increase should be allowed to show through completely into interest rates in reserve markets.  These actions, combined with the three adjustments initiated earlier this year by the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993. As always, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor economic and financial developments to judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  In taking the discount action, the Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of eleven Federal Reserve Banks -- Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco. The discount rate is the interest rate that is charged depository institutions when they borrow from their district Federal Reserve Bank.",1994-05-17
"The Federal Reserve Board today approved an increase in the discount rate from 4 percent to 4 3/4 percent, effective immediately.  In a related move, the Federal Open Market Committee decided that the increase in the discount rate should be reflected fully in interest rates in reserve markets.  These measures were taken against the background of evidence of persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilization. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve views these actions as necessary to keep inflation contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic growth.  In taking the discount rate action, the Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, St. Louis, and Kansas City. The discount rate is the interest rate that is charged depository institutions when they borrow from their district Federal Reserve banks.",1994-08-16
